                    <p class="body-two"><strong>Nethsara Geethanjana Weragoda</strong>, professionally known as
                        Nethsara
                        Weragoda (born 18 October 2001), is a Sri Lankan music producer, composer, and audio
                        engineer with a growing presence in the contemporary music scene. With over a decade of
                        hands-on experience, he has been actively involved in music production since 2014,
                        working across multiple roles including music composer, producer, mixing engineer,
                        recording engineer, and more recently, songwriter. <br><br>
                        Currently established as an emerging artist in Sri Lanka, Nethsara’s creative focus lies
                        primarily in Electronic music, Hip-Hop, and Pop, where he blends modern production techniques
                        with expressive musical storytelling. His work reflects a strong technical foundation paired
                        with an evolving artistic vision, positioning him as a versatile and forward-thinking producer
                        in the industry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-two mt-4"> Nethsara’s journey into music began at an early age, driven by a
                        deep-rooted
                        passion nurtured
                        within his family. At just three years old, his voice was recorded by his father on cassette
                        tapes—an early moment that unknowingly marked the beginning of a lifelong connection with
                        sound and recording. As he grew older, this curiosity transformed into ambition. With
                        limited resources but strong determination, he began experimenting with sound recording
                        using simple mobile hands-free devices, learning through trial, error, and persistence.
                        These early experiments, though imperfect and noisy, laid the groundwork for his
                        understanding of audio and production. </p>
                    <p class="body-two mt-4">
                        Over time, Nethsara refined his skills by combining formal musical education gained at school
                        with academic knowledge acquired through university studies, allowing him to develop a
                        structured yet creative approach to music production. This fusion of theory and practical
                        experience enables him to craft compositions that are both technically sound and emotionally
                        resonant.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-two mt-4">
                        Today, Nethsara Weragoda continues to evolve as an artist, dedicated to pushing creative
                        boundaries, building his sonic identity, and contributing meaningful work to the modern music
                        landscape-driven by the same passion that first inspired him in childhood.
